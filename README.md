# tposebot
That's a meme discord bot I did for a small group of friends: TPoseBot.
Motivation to do this project came from discord situations where one person
wanted to mute the other for x time, but always forgot to unmute back
after x time has passed.

Even though that's not the first bot that does that, I really
wanted to do it myself in order to learn from it, and as a bonus
I also wanted to include some meme features like tpose image web scraping.

As a curious programmer that loves discord environment, I must say it was 
a pretty fun thing to do.
